I have worked with this stack heavily, so found it easy to
set up and quickly develop within.

I reorganized the repo to separate storage/DB, API, and UI. 
I also updated the data mocker to use the latest faker (`@faker-js/faker`)
to reduce the amount of code that would need to be maintained.
I am not a big fan of `create-react-app` and prefer to make my
own webpack configs without all the unnecessary dependencies that 
CRA includes.
